        Time to survive--I am left out in this island. I came with a group of tourists to this island last night. However, last night I
        went bit aside of where the tourists at camping and made my own camp fire and slept there. However, even I got up, no one is
        there on the island. They left me. May be they searched for time, but couldn't find me I suppose. Now, I am left with three tools
        and I have to survive...

            <h4 style="color: red">Knife</h4>
            A cutting instrument consisting of a sharp-edged often pointed blade of metal fitted into a handle
            or onto a machine. As I am on <strong>adventure</strong> tour, I always carry some set of tools. One among them is <span style="color:orange">knife</span>.

    <article id="lighter">

            <p>The island is located to the south-east of florida. Perimeter might boe around 15 miles. Hover has a small fresh water
            lake. I can survive for couple of days by fishing and drinking the lake water. Fortunately, it has some trees such as
            coconut tree, banana tree and some small fruit trees. It has lots of timber tree. </p>

                <dt><strong>Knife</strong></dt>
                    <dd>I will cut some timber tree and make a small shelter to live. I can use it to cut the fruits and fishes</dd>
                <dt><strong>Rope</strong></dt>
                    <dd>Once I get the enough wood, i will tie them with rope accordingly to make a shelter. Also there is a
                    long tree in my vicinity. I can use this to climb the tree and look for any boats that are passing or to look for
                    other alternatives</dd>
                <dt><em><span style="color: yellow">Lighter</span></em></dt>
                    <dd>I will use this to make a camp fire with the wood I gathered. Would be bit safe with the fire near by me.</dd>
