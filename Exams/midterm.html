                    There are no other means of transportation on Clipperton Island than your own feet, and walking on the island is quite difficult. You will encounter two types of surfaces. One is soft sand, which collapses under your feet due to the burrows dug by the island's many crabs. The other surface is made out of hard coral fragments cemented together, covered with loose coral pieces. Watch where you put your feet so you don't step on the wrong piece and get an ankle sprain. If you consider this information a challenge, you may want to try and break the record time for running around the island. The fastest time noted is 1 hour and 17 minutes, by a radio amateur visiting the island in 2000.

                                It has, after all, many uses. You can use it to <b>open coconuts, make spears for fishing, and crack crab legs</b>.
                                And if the knife’s big enough, you can even use it to <span class="spanitem1">cut wood for your shelter and camp fires. </span>
                                Hardly surprising then, that it is the InterNations staff’s number one thing to take along with you to a desert island.

                <h2>Clipperton Island</h2>
                <span style="color:brown;">Clipperton Island is actually a coral atoll south of Mexico and west of Guatemala in the Pacific.</span><b>
                    It was claimed first by the French, then Americans, who mined it for guano.
                </b>
                Mexico took possession in 1897, and allowed a British company to mine guano there. In 1914, the Mexican civil war caused the island's 100 or so residents to be
                cut off from transportation and supplies. In 1917, the last surviving islanders, three women, were rescued and evacuated. Ownership reverted to France, which manned a
                lighthouse on Clipperton Island, but after World War II it was completely abandoned. <i>There are occasional scientific expeditions to the atoll.</i>
