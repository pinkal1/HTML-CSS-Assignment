<u><b>The Human Side of Interstellar:</u></b><br>
Interstellar is not a film. It is a divine marriage of philosophy, science fiction and essential life lessons. On a vehicle called Physics, Christopher Nolan takes you on a visually stunning journey through human emotions. When I watched it the second time, I was pleasantly surprised to find some of the scenes didn't register when I watched it first - something Christopher Nolan mentioned in one of his interviews. The science aspect of Interstellar has already been overdone. Let's look at the amazing life lessons and basic human nature Christopher puts across with great sophistication.<br><br>

<u><b>Father-daughter relationship:</u></b><br>
The first human aspect about the film is the father-daughter relationship which is the strong foundation on which the whole plot is meticulously constructed.  A daughter doesn't want her father to leave and a father's regret about leaving her to save the world. The most touching among them all, is the scene where Cooper says, 'I'm coming back...' and Murphy asks, 'When?'.<br><br>

<u><b>Smallness of humanity:</u></b><br>
Among other things, one thing I found striking is the clarity with which Nolan has put across a point we always knew - how insignificant we are. Billions of galaxies, each with a billion stars. And Among those, is Milky Way, with billions of stars, each with a solar system of its own. Around one such star revolves our planet. The vast emptiness of the universe is breathtaking, but our insignificance in it, is scary. When Romilly says, 'There's only a few millimeters of aluminum between me and nothing for millions a miles around', I felt the punch on my soul.<br><br>

<u><b>Nothing is impossible:</u></b><br>
At the risk of sounding like a self-help book, I would like to bring up two instances which re-emphasize the message. First, Cooper says, 'We will find a way, Professor, we always have'. Second, during my favorite docking scene, while Cooper is about to dock the just exploded endurance, CASE says, 'It is not possible', to which, Cooper replies, 'It is necessary'.  In spite of the stunning visuals and dominatingly brilliant background score, this dialogue blew me away. Just try to put in context, the things we do, to get what we want. The one explanation for why we do certain things in life - it is necessary.<br><br>

<u><b>Love:</u></b><br>
We all have people and things we love around us, and those who are not around us. Nolan very impressively introduces us to the reality that we have always failed to recognize, simply puts forward the truth in the most profound manner, through Amelia Brandt, when she very intensely delivers the line, 'Love is the one thing we're capable of perceiving that transcends time and space'. We perceive love. That is the truth, a truth that has struck me more than any other.<br><br>

Murphy, at the end, holds Cooper's hand and says, 'Nobody believed me, but I knew you'd come back' and Cooper asks, 'How?', she has tears rolling out of her eyes and says, "...Because my dad promised me'.<br><br>

<br clear="all">

Beyond the physics, wormholes, time dilation, space ships, time travel and extra-dimension tesseracts, Interstellar is the story of a father who travels through a wormhole, stops by on a couple of planets, escapes death and a spaceship explosion narrowly, goes back into past, comes back after about seventy years to keep a promise he made to his daughter.
