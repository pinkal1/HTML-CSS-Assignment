<h2><u>UDTA PUNJAB - SNIPPING WINGS OF CREATIVITY:</u></h2>
		
<p style="font-family: Book Antiqua;">

<b>The movie Udta Punjab, directed by Anurag Kashyap, is in the eye of the storm for allegedly casting the state of Punjab in a bad light, depicting it as drug infested state where drugs have destroyed the younger generation or even the elders. Though the film is yet to be released on 17th of July, everyone has an opinion about it though hardly anybody has seen it, including myself.</b> <br><br>

<p style="font-family: Book Antiqua;">

Well, it is difficult to say who is right and who is wrong, the makers of movie udta Punjab or the officials of the central board of film certification . Indeed, the freedom of expression is not absolute (remember no one tolerated a video on Lata Mangeshkar and Sachin Tendulkar) and sensibilities of the people must be kept in mind while dealing with controversial issues. I for one would comment on the movie Udta Punjab after having a "dekho". Does it condemns the drugs or glamourises them, is hard to say right now. But one thing is for sure when the Central Board of film certification led by over zealous.<br><br>

But one thing is for sure when the Central Board of film certification led by over zealous Mr Pahlaj Nihlani jumped the gun. In his fervor to protect the sentiments of the people of Punjab (who are yet to lodge a formal protest including the government of Punjab) he ordered 90+ cuts in a two-hour film, that amounts to a cut almost every two minutes. This is preposterous, a filmmaker would rather see the film with his family and friends than release it to public with 90 cuts. It is like bleeding a man to death with 90 jibes of a knife! <br><br>

Meanwhile, Anurag Kashyap the co-producer of the movie Udta Punjab is fighting it out in the court for release of the film without the cuts and has a wide support from across the film fraternity and the opponents of ruling coalition in Punjab. We Indians are very quick when it comes to standing for or against an issue or a person. This time, we stand with Anurag Kashyap and I think rightly so. If a film can stir one's consciousness and make a nation think then why not. A film alone cannot change the things. people can,especially when the elections are round the corner. The ruling Akali Das is yet to take an official stand on the film while AAP and the Congress party are out to support the release of the film. Movie Udta Punjab would  decide the limits of freedom of expression and the hold the political system has over the autonomous institutions of the country.
