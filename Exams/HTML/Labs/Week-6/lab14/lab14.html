<article>

<p class="AudioVideo">

Since 1896, athletics has been on the programme of each edition of the Games of the Olympiad. Its presence on the Games programme has allowed its popularity to increase across the world. This popularity was also strengthened by the creation of the IAAF in 1912. <br><br>

Women's events appeared for the first time at the 1928 Olympic Games in Amsterdam, while the men's programme was standardised as of the 1932 Games in Los Angeles. <br><br>

Jamaica's Usain Bolt wins Gold at London 2012 in the Men's 100m clocking a time of 9.63 seconds and setting a new Olympic record. Bolt was followed by fellow Jamaican Yohan Blake in silver and 2004 Olympic 100m Champion Justin Gatlin for bronze. <br><br>

This video also includes highlights from the semi-finals. <br><br>
