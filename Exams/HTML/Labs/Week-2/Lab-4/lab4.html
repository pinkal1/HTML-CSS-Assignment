<h2 style="text-align:center"><u>Website I like and reasons for liking the website:</u></h2>
<p style= "text-align:justify;font-size:17px">

A website should tell a story and communicate information seamlessly to the end-user, otherwise it runs the risk of turning visitors off completely.
Like a lot of people, I tried out Twitter and never planned to leave it since then. Most of the early twitter conversation was personal, but as the time passed by Twitter has grown up to become a critical business tool, ideal or following the latest news, tracking the ideas and whereabouts of people who will shape the future of technology, and sharing my own thoughts and attention stream.

<p style= "font-size:17px">
I thought I would outline here some of the specific things I find so compelling about Twitter, with suggestions about architectural features to be emulated by other internet services.</p>

<p style= "font-size:17px">
<p style="color:red;text-align:justify;font-size:17px"><b><u>1. TWITTER IS SIMPLE:</b></u>
<br><br>

Twitter does one small thing, and does it well. Folks like Robert Scoble sing the praises of Friendfeed, which you could think of as twitter++. After all, it's got comments and aggregation of data from multiple services. But despite its powerful premise, Friendfeed hasn't dented Twitter's growth. Personally, I don't have time to wade through the comments; for me, Twitter is about quick hits, not about extended discussion. And while I love the promise of service aggregation, I tend to think that trying to marry it to commenting obscures its potential. Less is more. New services like peoplebrowsr are reframing service aggregation in a richer way, as a way of learning more about the people you follow, browsing the social graph.</br></p>

<font color="#4169E1"><b><u>2. TWITTER WORKS LIKE PEOPLE DO:</b></u>
<br>
<p style="color:blue;text-align:justify;font-size:17px">
If I'm interested in someone, I don't have to ask their permission to follow them. I don't have to ask if they will be my friend: that is something that evolves naturally over time. If you're a public figure like I am, the metaphor of mutual "friending" is truly broken. I get tens of thousands of friend requests from people I don't know. Accepting would make it impossible for me to use a social tool to keep in touch with my real friends. Friend groups don't really help.</br>

<p style="text-align:justify;font-size:17px"><b><u>1. LACKING USABILITY:</b></u>
<br><br>
A website can often be the first impression of a company and a confusing website will push potential customers away just as quickly as they landed on it. And, this website does exactly that. I believe users need to be able to find what they are looking for with easy-to-navigate pages and readily accessible information that promotes further exploration. A clean layout with clear headers and information displayed in a user-friendly way encourages repeat visitors to frequent the site and obtain the information effortlessly.</br></body>

</p>

<b><u>2. INFORMATION OVERLOAD:</b></u>
<br>
<p style="text-align:justify;font-size:17px">

A bunch of words staring at potential customers will surely drive away the users and make them leave the website. Customers crave information but businesses need to be mindful not to over communicate main points. Provide key information that customers are looking for and relay it in a way that's easy for them to digest. Write in short sentence and in bullets when possible. By presenting focused information in a logical way customers can address their questions sufficiently.</font></br></p>
