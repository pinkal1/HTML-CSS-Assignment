<pre>One of my favorite hobby is travelling.</pre>
<blockquote>
Travelling helps in meeting and connecting with new people, which in turn helps in improving interpersonal skills. Depending upon the geography, we get to meet people from different races. It helps in understanding their background and their living styles. 
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
This experience of interacting with people from different races helps when we start working with a global team. Not just interpersonal skills, travelling also makes a person independent and builds the confidence of the person.

Apart from travelling, I also like playing outdoor sports. </pre>

At times, I even love to play badminton. It makes me   fit and also helps in relaxing a bit after a day's hard work.</p?
