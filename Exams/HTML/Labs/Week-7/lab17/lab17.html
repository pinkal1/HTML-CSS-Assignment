<h2><u>EVIL TWIN:</u></h2> 

<article>

<p align = "justify">

An evil twin is a rogue WiFi access point that appears to be legitimate but actually has been set up by a hacker to fool wireless users into connecting a laptop or mobile phone to a tainted hotspot. Once the victim connects to the evil twin, the hacker can listen to all Internet traffic or even ask for credit card information posing as a standard pay-for-access deal. Software sniffers allow hackers to passively intercept data sent between a web browser and web servers on the Internet. Hackers can capture any email, web search,
 or file transferred on an unsecured network.

<h2><u>PRECAUTION:</u></h2>

<b><u>Use a VPN:</u></b><br>
A virtual private network (VPN) connection is a must when connecting to your business through an unsecured connection, like a WiFi hotspot. Even if a hacker manages to position himself in the middle of your connection, the data here will be strongly encrypted. Since most hackers are after an easy target, they'll likely discard stolen information rather than put it through a lengthy decryption process.

<h2><u>PRECAUTION:</u></h2>

<b><u>Use SSL Connections:</u></b><br>
You aren't likely to have a VPN available for general Internet browsing, but you can still add a layer of encryption to your communication. Enable the "Always Use HTTPS" option on websites that you visit frequently, or that require you to enter some kind of credentials. Remember that hackers understand how people reuse passwords, so your username and password for some random forum may be the same as it is for your bank or corporate network, and sending these credentials in an unencrypted manner could open the door to a smart hacker. Most websites that require an account or credentials have the "HTTPS" option somewhere in their settings.

<b><u>PRECAUTION:</u></b>

<b><u>Use SSL Connections:</u></b>

<b>Man-in-the-Middle Attacks: </b>

Any device that lies between a user and a network server can execute manin-the-middle
attacks, which intercept and modify data exchanged between the user and the server.

<br>


<b>Precaution: </b>

Before you log into a hotspot, turn off file and printer sharing features so that others on the same network won't be able to access your personal information.

<br><br>




<b>Sidejacking: </b>

Sidejacking is a method where an attacker uses a packet sniffer, a program that can intercept or log traffic passing over a digital network, to steal
a session cookie containing usernames and passwords from a variety of websites, such as Facebook or LinkedIn.

<br>


<b>Precaution: </b> 

Use unique passwords for every website, composed of at least 12 upper and lower case letters, numbers and symbols.<br>
