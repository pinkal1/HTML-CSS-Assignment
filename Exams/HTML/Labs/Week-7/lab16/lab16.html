<h2><u>VIKTOR AHN (RUS), SHORT TRACK SPEED SKATING:</u> </h2>

<article class="article1">

<p>

Ahn was one of the leading international stories going into the Games. He had won three golds and one bronze while skating for South Korea as Ahn Hyun-Soo at the 2006 Olympics. Ahn did not qualify for the 2010 Olympics, and subsequent fallout with the Korea Skating Union led him to acquire Russian citizenship. He flourished with his new nation in Sochi, astonishingly bettering his 2006 Olympic medal haul. Ahn was .077 away from becoming the first person to sweep all four short track golds. 

</p>

<p>

Ahn became the most decorated Olympic short track skater of all time, matching Apolo Ohno in medals but with more golds. He has five World Cup victories.Kushnir won a bronze medal at the 2011 FIS Freestyle World Ski Championships.

<h2><u>IREEN WUEST (NED), SPEED SKATING:</u></h2>

<ol>

<li>
Ireen Wuest won her second Olympic title in the 3000m and helped the Netherlands to its first Olympic medal in the women's team pursuit, a gold.
</li>
   

<br>

<li>
Ireen Wuest also collected silvers in the 1000m, 1500m and 5000m, displaying the talent that's made her the three-time reigning World Allround champion.
</li>


<br>
   
<li>
Wuest, the most decorated athlete at these Games, became the eighth athlete to win five medals at one Winter Olympics. It's now been done at three straight Olympics, more commonplace with events being added to the program every four years.
</li>


<br>

<li>
No nation was as dominant in an individual sport as the Dutch speed skaters. It was a team effort, but if one person must be singled out, make it Wuest.
</li>

<br>

<li>       
Wuest, 27, said before the Olympics that she was hoping to compete in 2018. She is two medals away from the career Winter Olympic record for women.
