                  <em>I went to a cruise to Hawaii. Cruises always keep emergency boats. I saw that kind of  a boat hanging near the sidewall of the cruise. I was curious to check that boat. In the middle of the night, I just hopped into that hanging boat and suddenly it has lost the hook and it got dispatched from the cruise. I was left alone in the middle of the sea. I saw an island and I sailed the boat to the island. Luckily, in the emergency boat, there were few emergency things that helped me out such as a knife, fishing net and slipping bag..</em>

                                A sleeping bag is most definitely my least practical choice. My hope is that a sleeping bag will make nights more comfortable and result in a good night’s sleep. It makes my skin crawl to think about sleeping out in the open air without a layer of fabric to protect me from mosquitoes and bats and other nighttime creatures that are lurking around.
